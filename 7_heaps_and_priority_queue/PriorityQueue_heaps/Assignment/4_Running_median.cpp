Send Feedback
You are given a stream of N integers. For every i-th integer added to the running list of integers, print the resulting median.
Print only the integer part of the median.
Input Format :
The first line of input contains an integer N, denoting the number of integers in the stream.

The second line of input contains 'N' integers separated by a single space.
Output Format :
Print the running median for every integer added to the running list in one line (space-separated).
Input Constraints
0 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= Ai <= 10^5

Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1 :
6
6 2 1 3 7 5
Sample Output 1 :
6 4 2 2 3 4
Explanation of Sample Output 1 :
S = {6}, median = 6
S = {6, 2} -> {2, 6}, median = 4
S = {6, 2, 1} -> {1, 2, 6}, median = 2
S = {6, 2, 1, 3} -> {1, 2, 3, 6}, median = 2
S = {6, 2, 1, 3, 7} -> {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}, median = 3
S = {6, 2, 1, 3, 7, 5} -> {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, median = 4
Sample Input 2 :
5
