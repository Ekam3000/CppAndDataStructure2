balanced factor +ve and greater then 1 means it is left side imbalancd and balanced factor -ve and greater then 1 means it is right side imbalanced..
the direction of rotation (LL,LR,RL,RR) is predicted by direction of insersion followed
      40
    /    \
   20     50
  /  \      \
 10   30     60
 /   /  \
5   25   36
this is balanced BST 
     insert : 27
      40
    /    \
   20     50
  /  \      \
 10   30     60
 /   /  \
5   25   36
     \
     27
when we have insert 27 the direction followed for insersion is 40->20->30->25 which becomes the reason for imbalanced tree hence for rotation 40->20->30 elements are involved and LR rotation occured


Deletion of node from AVL tree
this is same as deletion of node from BST . but AVL Trees are height balanced trees . so if any node is becoming imbanced after deletion of a node from AVL , we perfored rotation for balancing it.
