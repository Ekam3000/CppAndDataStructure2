Send Feedback
Bracket sequence is called regular, if parenthesis in the given expression are balanced. You are given a string s, consisting of only '(' and ')' characters. You need to find its longest substring which is a regular bracket sequence. You have to find the number of such substrings as well.
Print first the length of output substring and then count of these. If no such substring exists, print "0 1" (without quotes).
Input format :
Line 1 : String s    
Constraints :
1 <= n (Length of string s) <= 10^6
Sample Input 1 :
)((())))(()())
Sample Output 1 :
6 2
Sample Input 2 :
))(
Sample Output 2 :
0 1
